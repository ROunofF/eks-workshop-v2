Before we deploy our retail store application, let's understand the fundamental Kubernetes concepts that make it work. These building blocks come together to create a robust microservices platform.

We'll explore the following core concepts using our retail store application:

- **[Pods](./pods)** - The containers that run your applications
- **[Deployments](./deployments)** - Managing and scaling your applications  
- **[Services](./services)** - Connecting applications together
- **[Namespaces](./namespaces)** - Organizing and isolating resources

Let's dive into each concept to see how they enable our microservices architecture.
